[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]
### Github repository containing all relevant code for Nature Medicine submission: DEEP LEARNING IDENTIFIES BODY COMPOSITION CHANGES OVER TIME IN TOTAL-BODY DXA IMAGING TO PREDICT ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY

## Installation and system requirements:
- Tested on CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
- Python version: 3.8.10
- To install dependencies, run:
```
python setup.py install
```

## Demo
- Demo script are provided in the notebooks folder
- A demo dataset is provided purely to validate model functionality, the dataset is not representative of the data used to train the models referenced in the manuscript
- To validate code functionality, run sample code in notebook corresponding to desired functionality (e.g. model_loading.ipynb for an example of how to load and test pretrained models)
- Code to recreate figures and statistical analyses from the manuscript is provided in modules/utils/analysis_scripts.py, more extensive example notebooks for these will be provided in the future
